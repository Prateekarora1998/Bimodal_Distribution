Implementing Bimodal distribution on the noisy dataset using neural network

Brief:

#This project represents the application of the BDR(bimodal distribution reomval) algorithm on the neural
network . Code presented in the file executes the algorithm on the training set of the data. The algorithm is 
also implemented on the dataset before the splitting the data to remove the outliers. These all applications
will provide some useful results which could be analysed for our report.

Prerequisite for the file to run:

# Anaconda and python should be installed in the pc or laptop
# pytorch or torch library should be installed by using the anaconda prompt
# Run the pytorch on CUDA if you have NVIDIA graphic card. This makes the running time
to be less (this is optional).

How to run the code:

# Open the anaconda prompt. Locate the drive in which folder is stored
# Type "jupyter notebook" and after you press the enter you will be able to see the local host formed on
your pc or laptop.
# After that go to the location of folder and you will find ".ipynb" file.
# After opening the file, just click on the "cell" written on the top of the jupyter notebook and click on
"run all cells". In this way, you will be able to the run the code as well as you will be able to visualize 
the plots drawn for your analysis or you could press "Shift + Enter" to run the code written in every cell.
